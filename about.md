My name is **Renato**, I'm __Front End Developer/Designer__ based in **Rijeka, Croatia**.

I have been in the "web dev" field for nearly a year, and have been loving every second of it. I am a designer, developer, problem solver and everyday learner.

Since December 2015, I've been designing and developing **@ InformGuest** startup as a **Front-End Developer** and **Lead Designer**.

I enjoy reading about web technologies, spending time watching videos on YouTube and reading tech books.

I'm gamer.
